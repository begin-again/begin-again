## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full stack developer with expertise in NodeJS, Angular, Gulp, git, training, among other talents. Love NodeJS and the command-line. Prefer test driven design.

### want to work with

- Nice people
- Linux
- Kubernetes
- Cloud
- NodeJS


### currently learning

Electron, VueJS, Webpack


## stuff I work(ed) with

### Dorsett Controls

2022 - Present

I work in a multiple respository Windows environment with git for windows and VS-Code. The product is installed on-prem with custom installers. My GH activity does appear on my profile but the company repositories are private.

- Electron (currently upgrading to v16)
- NodeJS (events, async, stream, child process)
- Grunt
- Vue
- Mongo
- SQL
- BASH (aliases, gnu tools)
- git (intermediate user)
-  Documentation (lots)
   - JSDoc code comments
   - Policy (style guide, coding standards)
-  GitHub

### East Carolina University

2017 - 2021

I worked in a multiple respository Windows environment with git for windows and VS-Code. Most of my commits are on the university GitHub Enterprise server without cloud support. :confounded:
  
-  ColdFusion (2018, CFScript, coldbox, testbox, mockbox)
-  NodeJS (streams, events, child process)
-  Angular JS & 7/11/12
-  Gulp
-  BASH (git hooks, aliases, gnu tools)
-  Mocha / Sinon / Jasmine / Karma
-  Test Driven Design (when possible)  
-  yargs ( I create lot of command-line tools )
-  git (intermediate user, trainer, bit of plumbing)
-  SQL (oracle)
-  Documentation (lots)
   - JSDoc code comments
   - Functional test scenarios
   - User manuals
   - Policy
-  GitHub Enterprise
-  Typescript
   -  converting NodeJS CLI apps
   -  Angular 7/11/12


#### cool stuff I created @ ECU

_Not publically available_

- auto-node picker (library, NodeJS)
  - finds an installed version of nodeJS suitable for a repository based on it's engines property. Requires NVM (windows or Linux).
  - allows developers to be running multiple versions of NodeJS in multiple shells without having to be concerned about what a repository might support
  - I realize that there are open source tools that can do some of this but this does everything I need.
- NodeJS Spawner (NodeJS)
  - using the above picker, have created generic spawner which works on NodeJS scripts, commands, REPL, angular-cli. For instance, yarn by itself operates on current working directory, but with this tool one can run any yarn command in any path `sp -n yarn -p /some/where -c <command> -v <optional node version including just a major or major.minor> -o <optional flag to select oldest installed satisfying version> -- <params for yarn>` (sp is a shell alias)
- centralized builders (NodeJS)
  - we have lots repositories which used to have individual build scripts (gulp). Making changes required numerous pull requests. By centralizing the building code into a single repository (currently a mono-repo with several builders) I've reduced maintenance significantly.
- release commits (TM ðŸ˜„) (NodeJS)
  - with so many repositories, deployments used to involved running a build for each and then zipping up the result to be passed on to a deployment system. Even when running in parallel and an offline package mirror this took a long time. My solution was to build the repository targeting a folder in the repository itself. I then built tools for developers to create a release commit and another to copy a release commit into a web root or where ever. Deployments are super fast now. And PR reviewers no longer need to build a repository for functional review.
- yarn audit scanner (NodeJS, GH Rest API)
  - using the yarn 1.x audit function, download the package.json/yarn.lock for every deployable (denoted via repository tags) repository and run yarn audit dumping the result as json. Then procress these files to create issues in the impacted repositories. These issues contain a human readable component (of every dependency with a CVE) and a serialized compressed comment. Acting as a database, read these comments to detect changes between scanning runs so that tool knows to update, close, or create an issue.
